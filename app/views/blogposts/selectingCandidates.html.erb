    <h5 class="blogPostText" style="font-style: italic;">This is the third post of our new series: Landing Professional and Academic Opportunities. Earlier posts can be found<a class="NoUnderlineForAuthorLinks" href="/blog/#EarlierPosts"> here</a>.<h5>
    <br>
    <h5 class="blogPostText">Applying to jobs and internships can often be a black box; you submit your resume and simply hope for the best. Having gone through the application and interview process as a student, and as a member of the selection committee at several firms, I want to provide some transparency about how we actually selected candidates for interviews. As a disclaimer, these insights are solely based on my personal experience and may not be representative. Nonetheless, some context can be helpful.
    <br>
    <br>
    Our recruiting team was broken down by universities. Villanova was always a target school and as such had a dedicated team of recruiters who were normally Villanova alumni though others were welcome. We had a team leader who was responsible for organizing our recruiting efforts, both on campus and off campus. The team leader would liaise with Human Resources (HR) to coordinate our outreach strategy.
    <br>
    <br>
    As part of our recruiting efforts, we did our best to physically go to campus to meet with students several times during application season. Following such events, (firmwide presentations, resume workshops, etc.) HR would ask us if any candidates stood out. Any candidates we mentioned would automatically join the conversation for getting an interview. Once the application deadline passed, HR would compile the resumes of all applicants from Villanova, organize them into a PDF and email it to all members of the recruiting team. Based upon the number of available interview slots, we would then rank the resumes (e.g. if there were 28 interview slots we would select the top 28 resumes). Often times the resume book easily exceeded 150+ applicants. Between working a full-time job and having other commitments, it can be a burdensome task, to say the least, for employees to objectively sift through every resume. Additionally, there were not any universal guidelines for selecting the top 28; it was up to each of us to use our best judgment and personal criteria in order to do so.
    <br>
    <br>
    Given such a task, it is inevitable that certain natural biases will take over. For instance, people will likely favor:
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul class="extraTab">
        <li class="blogPostText">Familiar names or those they know</li>
        <li class="blogPostText">Well formatted, mistake free resumes</li>
        <li class="blogPostText">Experience in the industry and/or at well-known firms</li>
        <li class="blogPostText">Engagement in activities they can relate to/understand (e.g. someone who is in the same organization they were in during undergrad)</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Furthermore, everyone will use their own unique process to select resumes. For instance, some analysts who were overwhelmed with work decided to split the task; each selected 14 and combined them make 28. Others, upon potentially adding someone to the pile of 28, would look the candidate up on Facebook and make a final determination based upon their profile picture. Meanwhile, others would lean heavily towards selecting athletes, while others would only choose people who met a certain GPA threshold.
    <br>
    <br>
    After each person came up with their top resumes, the team would gather to discuss who would be part of the final 28 candidates to receive interviews. Each meeting inevitably began with selecting people who were well connected to influential members of the firm and were guaranteed to get an interview, irrespective of merit. The remaining slots were chosen more traditionally. Someone would present a person, along with their rationale for selecting their resume, and others would chime in accordingly. This is why it is important to have a great 30-second commercial when introducing yourself. A great, concise commercial not only increases the chances a representative will remember you while sifting through the stack, but also aids their ability to pitch your candidacy to others. If you need help coming up with your commercial, or aren't exactly sure what it is just <a class="NoUnderlineForAuthorLinks" href="mailto:general@AdviceShare.co">email the Adviceshare team</a>.

    Though the discussions never got extremely heated, there were debates, especially as the number of spots dwindled. How did we solve the debates? While it is intuitive to think we did so based upon objective factors like a candidate's GPA or experience, we did not. In fact, there were times where the committee decided we already had enough high GPA's and it was time to diversify the candidate pool. Instead, debates were mostly solved by the passion and persuasiveness of a candidate’s in-room advocate. When I was applying to the firm where I eventually got my start, my in-room advocate asked me to pitch myself to him before I applied. Later on, he told me that he used the same pitch I gave him to get me through to the interview stage. Though we were thoughtful in selecting candidates for interviews, the meetings lasted an hour tops. It was important, but there was also work to be done.
    <br>
    <br>
    My experiences on both sides of the application process have taught me the importance of the following:
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Attending events and building connections.</strong> It’s extremely important to have relationships with decision makers. It begins with attending events and is solidified with timely follow ups. Though some will have more than others, all representatives who attend events will have a degree of influence. Don't just crowd around the senior representatives and ignore the junior people. As a junior analyst I was personally able to advocate for several people to get interviews and likewise saw junior analysts prevent people from getting interviews. 
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Selling yourself to earn an in-room advocate.</strong> Without a voice in the room to speak on your behalf, it is incredibly difficult to make it through the resume selection process. Don’t stop at establishing an initial connection with an employee at a firm. Develop the relationship and provide them with strong reasons to advocate on your behalf, whether it is having an interesting story, asking thoughtful follow up questions, or showing your passion for the firm by staying in contact over several months. Give them enough to convince <em>someone else</em> that you are worthy of an interview.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Realizing it's not always about merit...in fact it might never be.</strong> When you apply to a position you will have to overcome several things outside of your control such as how well connected other people are and the inherent biases of decision-makers. In my experience, less than 20% of the people who dropped their resumes at a school were offered an interview even though more than 50% of them were probably qualified. While you may be confident you are one of the most qualified candidates for a position, put in the extra effort to boost your chances.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Managing your social media presence.</strong> People will google your name and look through your online profiles. Make sure everything they see and read is representative of the brand you want to portray. Even the strongest candidate can’t overcome bad pictures or derogatory posts.
    <br>
    <br>
    Though the first hurdle is getting to the interview stage, the biggest hurdle to landing a highly coveted position is acing the actual interview.
